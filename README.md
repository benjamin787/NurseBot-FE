# NurseBot

A react app available **[here](http://covid-nurse-bot.web.app)** that hosts a chatbot for Covid-19-related information.  The goal is to provide a central location for references so people don't need a dozen tabs open to find what they need. These references are to be stored in menus on the left, some constant and some based on user input.

### Prerequisites

Before you continue, please ensure you have installed the latest version of React.

### Installation && Usage

Click [here](http://covid-nurse-bot.web.app) to see it as is.

Following the traditional fork + clone, run *npm install* so you can serve locally.

CLI commands (check package.json scripts) *npm build | test | start* that will be useful.

See NurseBot_BE for the Dialogflow integration and message formatting.
